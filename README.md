# What's New?
Contributor: [Tanisha L Davey](https://github.com/tanishalatoya)


## Abstract
**Technologies used:** _React, jQuery, React Testing Library, Jest-DOM Library, Webpack_

What's new is a single page application built with `create-react-app` that displays news articles onto the DOM based on a selected category or a search value. This app was built over the course of four days using React. Currently, the news articles are being pulled in via a static database and will be updated in a future iteration to get news articles using a browser's fetch API.
